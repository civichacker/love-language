# Love Language Schemas

In our pursuit to use technology to benefit all Humans, we want to encode human concepts that will help us build the tools for Liberty and Justice for all. The schemas and examples in this repository hopes to help those who seek to build information systems and make the concepts to help us fight oppression machine-readable.


## Schemas

Included in this work are schemas for the following concepts:

- [Use of Force](./examples/use-of-force/README.md) (applied by law enforcement)
- Environmental Sensors
- Legislation
- Open Data
